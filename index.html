		<p>For this assignment we were supposed to design a poster for the Herpatology Club open house event, which happened to be on Valentine&rsquo;s Day.  We were also required to take our own pics for it.  I had some bit of fun take pics of the reptiles in Magruder, but it was also pretty freaky.  I wasn&rsquo;t having fun being that close to those lizards.  Kept thinking they were gonna get out or something&hellip;  I originally made 3 different layouts because I really like the images I got and couldn&rsquo;t decide which was best.  Eventually I chose this one and the tag line fit really well.  It was weird to break some of the usual things we do and actually use a cheesy script font and a big goofy heart in the background.</p>

		<p>I spent a lot of time over the past week researching web design and working on our first real project in VisComm 3.  I choose to take a 960.gs approach because after doing some research it became apparent that it was previously a popular way to do web design prior to the responsive web design stuff.  It is a psd file that has columns set up already, you design the website in photoshop, and then use css to layout your site according to how you did it in photoshop.  I figured that since we are all about using grids for print design, it makes sense to use them for web layout as well.  I went with a 12 column grid.</p>

<p>The hardest trouble I had was with javascript.  I&rsquo;m not familiar with it.  I want to have some practical javascript not just some simple little button.  I went about trying to implement Fancybox into the website and spent many hours trying to get it to work.  Eventually I figured it out, the code I used had an extra javascript(); once I took that out it started working.  I went on to use Fancybox for the images and to open and iFrame to load a youtube video.</p>

<p>I really liked the approach of trying to design a website the way a real web designer would have, the tutorials I watched were incredibly valuable.  I had more fun watching the tutorials and learning the pracices than I did actually doing my own work.  For the next project I want to take the same approach, but learn responsive design.</p>

		<p>We had to redesign the horrible advertisement for the Truman MAE program.  I went with a photographic approach and put an apple on some books and took pics of it at the library in front of a chalkboard.  I played around with the idea of writing the advertisement on the chalkboard but if I did that it would be harder to remove if I did it wrong than to just put white text on a clean chalkboard. After this we learned how to do the spot color channels in photoshop which more or less just makes me want to not use photos for 2 color projects.<br/>

		<p>The assignment was to redesign a poster we found on campus.  The one I did was an advertisement for APO volunteering to help other organizations.  I kept the same idea of having the logo in the middle, which apparently is good for making it easier to remember who the poster is for.  With the old one the hierarchy didn&rsquo;t go along with the message so I made mine so that first you read &lsquo;let&rsquo;s team up&rsquo; then the apo logo, then you go down to the block of information.  Having it tilted by 20 degrees makes it a little more interesting to look at and eye catching, without affecting the readability like 45 degrees would to make your head tilt.<br/>

		<p>I spent another 4 hours adding to the website and tweaking things.  I added google analytics to the site to track when people visit and what they click on.  I changed the logo for github so that it doesn&rsquo;t look like the Google &lsquo;g&rsquo;, later I&rsquo;ll change the googleplus logo because right now it is a Picasa logo.  Changed the stupid default font for my name and replaced it with Google&rsquo;s Roboto webkit font family.  The search function still doesn&rsquo;t seem to work for me but that&rsquo;s not a crucial difference right now. I added some rake tasks to the rake file that will rename the filenames in the _posts directory so that the filenames will match the post dates (for anytime that the post is created, and worked on for long enough that the post time is different from when it&rsquo;s created.  Because the name of the file is the url).  Another rake task that pings Google, Bing, and Pingomatic about new changes to the website.  I&rsquo;ve contemplated adding a rake task that will make posts unpublished by default, but if I did that I&rsquo;ll have to find a way to delete files from Amazon s3 or else there would be duplicates.<br/>
Now my method of deploying is:</p>

<pre><code>rake generate   
git add .   
git commit -m 'some comment about the post'  
git push origin source   
rake deploy   
rake s3   
rake notify   
</code></pre>

		<p>This is the first post!  4 hours of fiddling and I&rsquo;ve finally got a blog up and running.  I chose to run my blog using the Octopress framework, it lets me use static files so that I have full control and can practice my html, markup, css, and everything outside of class instead of having a website that does it all for me.  My method is that I am using Amazon S3 for hosting the static files, but using Amazon Cloudfront to distribute those files to provide an increase in speed.  I am also using github as a version control system, that way if I make an mistakes I can always go back to how the site was previously.  I expect I will need that a lot in the beginning.  You can view the github site at racedale.github.io.  It should be the same as this site, one may be more ahead of another depending on what I send the files to first.  Probably github for rough drafts and test but amazon for the final drafts.</p>
