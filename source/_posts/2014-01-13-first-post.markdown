This is the first post!  4 hours of fiddling and I've finally got a blog up and running.  I chose to run my blog using the Octopress framework, it lets me use static files so that I have full control and can practice my html, markup, css, and everything outside of class instead of having a website that does it all for me.  My method is that I am using Amazon S3 for hosting the static files, but using Amazon Cloudfront to distribute those files to provide an increase in speed.  I am also using github as a version control system, that way if I make an mistakes I can always go back to how the site was previously.  I expect I will need that a lot in the beginning.  You can view the github site at racedale.github.io.  It should be the same as this site, one may be more ahead of another depending on what I send the files to first.  Probably github for rough drafts and test but amazon for the final drafts.
