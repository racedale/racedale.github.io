###Gouache

Gouache is interesting.  It's very similar to watercolor, but I'd say it's more manageable.  Most of the time.  The gesso doesn't really make sense to me and I can't seem to get that working out right, maybe I'm not using enough?, because the gouache is basically going down and coming up in a way similar to watercolor, just in a more manageable way.  I am also having trouble finding good youtube videos for using gouache, unlike when I would look up watercolor videos.  That just means I'm even more helpless than before, not a very good sign.
