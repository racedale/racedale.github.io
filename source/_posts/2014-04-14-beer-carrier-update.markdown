I added some more content to my carrier, made the stripes straight vertical instead of a weirdo tilt, and made some other small tweaks to adjust the fit of the bottles.  I made two different handle designs so I could test out which one would hold the weight of the bottles better without tearing.  I also made the handles long so they can fold over twice to make them hopefully not tear.
