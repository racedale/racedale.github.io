###Watercolor Skull

Big might be more time consuming, but it's also a lot of fun.  Part of it was getting to choose the content and choosing to do something that looks bad ass... but the other part was that since it's bigger you're not obsessing over painting carefully within tiny lines as much.  Unfortunately though, I did have a fair bit of that going on with painting the flames.  This illustration made me want to do more of the cool/manly drawing instead of landscapes and birds, it's so much more fun.  At least now I have something I can hang up on my wall!
