I did a new photoshoot with a better photostudio set up and a new model based off of the mockups from last time, and I got enough photos that I was able to pick out this one to use.  After some photoshopping I'm happy with how it turned out.  I had to look up a really old Dracula book to figure out what it said on the back and inside pockets instead of modern day books that just say a bunch of "New York times bestseller!" sticker nonsense.  I made my own about the author section based off of the Wikipedia article about the guy.
