###Watercolor Product Illustration

I thought I had chosen something cool.  I thought I had chosen something simple.  "Oh, it's mostly grey and shaded so there won't be that much color mixing..." I was very wrong.  Though it might have been mostly grey, it was practically every shade of grey, which is basically more color mixing than using multiple colors.  Huge mistake #1.  It's also rounded/spherical at parts, making the shading even more of a continuous tone change and impossible.  Huge mistake #2.  The lighting was pretty reflective, you know, since it's made of metal... Huge mistake #3.

While I do think it turned out kinda cool, it was a huge bitch to work on.  I spent almost all of my time trying to mix and layer the greys to get shading to look somewhat normal, and the end result is still a bit splotchy.
