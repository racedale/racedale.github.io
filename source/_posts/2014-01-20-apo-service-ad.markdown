The assignment was to redesign a poster we found on campus.  The one I did was an advertisement for APO volunteering to help other organizations.  I kept the same idea of having the logo in the middle, which apparently is good for making it easier to remember who the poster is for.  With the old one the hierarchy didn't go along with the message so I made mine so that first you read 'let's team up' then the apo logo, then you go down to the block of information.  Having it tilted by 20 degrees makes it a little more interesting to look at and eye catching, without affecting the readability like 45 degrees would to make your head tilt.
