This post is for my Final Portfolio, it contains the work I've done over the second half of the semester.  They will be in the order of oldest to newest.

These were from the Beverage design assignment.  I spent a good amount of time coming up with a concept and ended up with a "It's better to ask forgiveness than permission" approach after checking the beer label laws to make sure I could.  The idea was to market to basically rural folk with an American Double IPA beer to get a high alcohol content, and named it Double-Wide IPA.  Partially because it has the abbreviation "DWI" to get peoples attention, and partly because of the stereotype of white trash people living in Double Wide trailers.  Everyone I showed this concept to said they would buy one if they saw it in a store so that's good enough for me!

This was the Brochure design assignment.  I ended up having a little too much content (around 5800 words instead of 5000), but I decided to keep it all instead of getting rid of any to make sure I didn't get rid of anything relevant and also as an extra design challenge to figure out how to cram all that in.  After a lot of massaging it started to come together, and once I got the replacement pictures in the end of the brochure it didn't suck.  My main challenge was that anytime I changed anything it would shift the whole document and I would have to go through fixing all the widows and orphans again and again and again...

These were from the Dust Jacket/Book Cover design assignment.  I really liked this project for some reason.  Maybe because I liked reading Dracula or because I didn't spend a month working on it like the other projects to make me hate it.  I had a hard time choosing a concept because there are soooo many ways you could go with Dracula.  I ended up going with something I'd actually be able to photoshop instead of trying to build some kind of scene from the book like I originally felt like doing (thank god).  I enjoyed doing photoshoots and using the photostudio and really had fun with all that.  It makes me want to have a better lens and everything but that's all super expensive.  I found it amazing how you can get professional looks from my cheap little $200 Panasonic Lumix.  It really makes me love my camera even more.  I even filmed my beer commercial in 1080p with it!  Anyways, photoshoots are fun, but getting someone to be a model isn't.  I kept trying to find someone, and they'd either be too busy or they would cancel on me.  That made getting images to start the project difficult.  So then I had to just find someone and take quick and dirty photos to rough up a mock up of what I planned on doing, then used that to show other people when I was trying to do a real photoshoot.


###End Stuff
As far as time budgets go for these project I'd say I've definitely gone over on the beverage project...  I budgeted my time well for the brochure when I was actually working on it, the main problem I had was that I had to wait to take pictures for when it fit around other peoples schedules which put me after the official deadline.  I was under budget for the book cover project as far as time spent, but technically I didn't start working on it until the last week so I was able to put all my focus into it and get it done really fast.  The main things that caused problems for me for budgeting my time was having to deal with being able to still spend enough time on all my other classes and to work around other peoples schedules.

As far as a general self-reflection, I found that when it comes down to the grind I'm able to pump out my work a lot faster than I used to be able to.  But after finishing everything and looking back I realize that I would basically pick whatever the most do-able concept I had for a project and run with that, and I kinda wish that I'd have chosen to do something more complex somewhere.  Except I never would have had the time so in the end I made the right decision.  I'm looking forward to Illustration next semester so I can get that skill to be better, until then I'll keep relying on my photography skills.  I also love Web Design and want to focus most of my time on learning that now, so I hope we have more practical projects with that in the future.
