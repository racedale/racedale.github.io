I took a bunch of pictures in a ghetto studio I rigged up in my room to get a feel for how I was going to do my dust jacket.  This image was the one that worked out the best with my concept for Dracula.  Some other ideas I had would have been cool, but were not practical with the time budget we have... too much photoshopping would have needed to happen.  It's also suprisingly difficult to convince people to be a model.
