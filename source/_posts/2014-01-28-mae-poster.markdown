We had to redesign the horrible advertisement for the Truman MAE program.  I went with a photographic approach and put an apple on some books and took pics of it at the library in front of a chalkboard.  I played around with the idea of writing the advertisement on the chalkboard but if I did that it would be harder to remove if I did it wrong than to just put white text on a clean chalkboard. After this we learned how to do the spot color channels in photoshop which more or less just makes me want to not use photos for 2 color projects.
