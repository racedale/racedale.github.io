I made a bunch of small tweaks to get the brochure approved and added some new pictures towards the end where the smaller ones weren't working.  After some endless tweaking to get rid of ever preset widows and orphans, it finally got approved.  I made this one in spread format so that it's easier to view the front and back together on a computer.
