###Zombie Academy

This is the illustration for the zombie academy web banner.  Inspiration was from Scooby Doo on Zombie Island.  The shading was one of the hardest parts, because that was the key to making it less boring.  I'm not sure what the point of making a web banner illustration without actually making it a web banner was, cause it's basically just a normal illustration.  But as far as doing marker comps go, it's really fun to use those markers.  Way better than shitty crayola markers.
