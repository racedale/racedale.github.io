###Midterm Portfolio

####Reflection
Coming into Illustration I had a fairly negative mindset due to the fact that I've always been terrible at drawing.  Yet I'd say I've learned more about drawing in this class already than in both drawing 1 and 2 combined.  The thing you said of 'If you can't draw then just trace it, eventually you'll figure out how to not suck' is actually pretty true.  I've never been allowed to trace before and now that I can it's like following in the footsteps of someone who was good at drawing and learning from them.  It also helps with focusing on line quality and more advanced drawing techniques when you aren't constantly thinking about whether it looks "right".
I also thought I was going to hate watercolor at first, but I watched some youtube videos of experts doing stuff with it and tried to emulate them.  While obviously I didn't create the masterpieces they do, it's at least a recognizable image, and for the most part water color is fun.
The hardest learning curve was easily the digital illustrations...  But once you get used to it I enjoyed the things I drew with it.  It seems like it's kinda like learning to ride a bike, it makes no sense at first, but eventually I'm sure it'll feel more natural.
All in all, I'm looking forward to doing more illustrations, but I already know I won't have the time to work on them that I want to.
