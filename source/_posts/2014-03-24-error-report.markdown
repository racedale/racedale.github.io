For the beverage label project I was missing the magazine ad, the 3 posters, the design of the 6 pack, and the 15 second commercial.  This is an anylization of why I missed the deadline.  

The budget on the label was correct and I more or less met that I just spread that time out too much working on other school work. But when I came to the 6 pack carrier I ran into trouble.  The first speed bump was that the HP printer was out of order, and since the project was for 22x28 paper that's what I was planning on using.  I then had to redesign a new style of 6 pack for 17x22 paper so that I could get some physical mock ups and start testing the fit.  I have the fit basically down now and the design work on it is ready to begin.  

My main problem would be because of my process.  For the branding and the commercial I needed to use the actual bottle, which meant I couldn't begin that until I had finished the label.  Once that is done I can photograph the bottles for my ads and use them in my commercial.  This process makes the budget for the rest of the project weigh on the first design, and the delays on that design compounded for every design after that.
