For this assignment we were supposed to design a poster for the Herpatology Club open house event, which happened to be on Valentine's Day.  We were also required to take our own pics for it.  I had some bit of fun take pics of the reptiles in Magruder, but it was also pretty freaky.  I wasn't having fun being that close to those lizards.  Kept thinking they were gonna get out or something...  I originally made 3 different layouts because I really like the images I got and couldn't decide which was best.  Eventually I chose this one and the tag line fit really well.  It was weird to break some of the usual things we do and actually use a cheesy script font and a big goofy heart in the background.

This is the animated banner that we had to make.  Took forever to get it to look smooth.

This is the website design I made for the Herpatology club.  I made sure to type up some content because I wanted it to look more realistic than Lorem Ipsum text.
