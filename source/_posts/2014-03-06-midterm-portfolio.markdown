For my time budgets that I spent on these projects I am proud to say that I don't t hink I really went over budget on any of them, at least not enough to notice.  I made sure to always be under budget by the due date so I'd have some left over time to get some revisions done.  My thought process while working on these was to kind of 'rush' it so that I'd be able to get the initial progress down and then spend most of my time revising it.  I also spent a significant amount of time coming up with concepts and brainstorming, which I think helped my projects to reduce how many times I'd need to start over.  If I wanted to improve my time management I think I just need to make sure my concepts are actually good before I do them, because for the Jazz Combo one it didn't work out.  

As far as a general self-reflection, I'd say I learned quite a few things of what I am good and what I am bad at.  I think I am good at getting the work done once I know what my idea is, meaning I am good at the computer design work.  I'm also decent at coming up with ideas, but it kinda takes a lot of time so I'm not that good.  I think I'm also decent at taking pictures, but that might be because I know I am terrible at illustrating so I need to be good at it.  I'm obviously bad at Illustration, and some times I just make some dumb mistakes layout wise and forget stuff like how the margin is supposed to be and it makes me have to totally start over.  I'm also bad at keeping track of my time and printing things off on a regular basis.  Now that I know what this midterm portfolio is like, I'm confident I can do a better job for the next one!
