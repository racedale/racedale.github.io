###Watercolor Landscapes and a bird

I definitely enjoy doing landscapes.  Maybe it's that Bob Ross effect, but it's decently relaxing. Except when you have 10 to do and have to wait for them to dry before painting the next part... I eventually started doing 2-3 at a time and rotating between them so I wasn't waiting so long for it to dry. I tried a couple new techniques.  One I tried to do a super abstract fall scene, ended up pretty unrecognizable.  Another I tried to do a field of flowers, and was trying to just blot the general shape of them but it didn't turn out well.  I'm thinking maybe it was still a little too wet.  I think when I do a landscape on a full sheet of paper it looks better, and I think that it's probably because then I'm using a bigger brush and focusing more on the general idea of things instead of specific details with a smaller brush.
