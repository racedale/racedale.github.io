###Watercolor Landscapes and a bird

I definitely enjoy doing landscapes.  Maybe it's that Bob Ross effect, but it's decently relaxing. Except when you have 10 to do and have to wait for them to dry before painting the next part... I eventually started doing 2-3 at a time and rotating between them so I wasn't waiting so long for it to dry. I tried a couple new techniques.  One I tried to do a super abstract fall scene, ended up pretty unrecognizable.  Another I tried to do a field of flowers, and was trying to just blot the general shape of them but it didn't turn out well.  I'm thinking maybe it was still a little too wet.  I think when I do a landscape on a full sheet of paper it looks better, and I think that it's probably because then I'm using a bigger brush and focusing more on the general idea of things instead of specific details with a smaller brush.

Thought I'd have some fun with drawing a bird and do something silly by doing Road Runner.  It actually had some challenges I wasn't expecting... since it was a cartoon it was very flat and I had to sort of create some shadows on it's feet to make them look correct.  Also since it was a cartoon, it needed to have bright colors which meant I had to do multiple coats and mix up some new paint to get it right.
