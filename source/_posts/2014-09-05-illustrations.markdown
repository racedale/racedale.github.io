###Hand illustrations

I came into this fully expecting to hate hands because I've never been good at them, but I actually turned out to like them.  I tried to vary the types of hands instead of always doing the same kind.  It was also the first real time of figuring out the frustrations of the drawing tablet.  Pressure sensitivity is a strange thing to get used to when you aren't looking at the pen or really applying that much pressure.  It felt like hands are a good example of "you don't have to actually draw it, you just need to hint at what it's supposed to be and your eyes do the rest".
