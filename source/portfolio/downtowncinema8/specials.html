<h1 id="giftcertificates" style='text-align: left;font-weight:400; font-size: 36px; line-height: 30px;'>Gift Certificates</h1>

<p>We sell <span class="bold">gift certificate booklets</span> in denominations of $10.00.  Each booklet has 5 - $2.00 pages in it, which can be used to purchase tickets or concession items.</p>

<p>Our admission prices are $8.50 for adults (13 - 61), $6.50 for children (3 - 12), senior citizens ( 62+ and AARP members), and all admissions to movies that start before 6PM.  College students get a $7.50 rate on Friday - Sunday, with a college ID, and a $6.50 rate on Monday - Thursday, with a college ID.  Since we now feature 3-D digital movies, there is an increase of $2.50 per ticket for the 3-D movies.</p>

<p>We do offer some ways to receive gift certificate booklets, without coming to the theater.</p>

<ol>
    <li>If you would like for the booklets to be <span class="bold">mailed</span> to someone, we have 2 methods:
    <ul>
    <li>Please enclose a check for $10.00 per booklet, plus $1.50 for 1 - 5 booklets, $2.25 for 6 - 10 booklets, or $3.00 for 11 - 15 booklets, for shipping and handling. 
You can mail a check to Jim Fitzpatrick, 25902 Banner Lane, Gibbs, MO 63540.  The check should be made out to Downtown Cinema 8. <br>
I use my home address because I check the mail there every day!  I usually send the booklets out the next day.  Remember to enclose the full address of the recipient.</li>
<li>We can process the order over the phone using a credit card.  You can call 660-665-5684.  Best hours - 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM, Monday - Friday. <br>
The mailing charges listed above also apply to credit card purchases.  No extra charges for boxoffice pickups.<br>
The order can be shipped to any person and location you choose.</li>
</ul>
</li> 
<li>If you would like to have the gift certificates <span class="bold">picked up</span> at the theater by the recipient, there will be no shipping and handling charges. 
Just enclose $10.00 for each booklet, as well as the name of the person who will be picking them up.
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any other questions, the business phone number is 660-665-5684 (theater), or 660-342-1328 (cell)</p>

<h1 id="birthdayparties" style='text-align: left;font-weight:400; font-size: 36px; line-height: 30px;'>Birthday Parties</h1>
<p>We have a room that you can use <span class="bold">free of charge</span>.  The room is about 9' x 10'.  It has a 2.5' x 6' table, that can seat 8 people around the table.</p>

<p>We do have a <span class="bold">game room</span> for the kids to use, if the parents choose.  Some games dispense tickets that can be redeemed for novelty items.  Most of the games are 25 cents each, some are 50 cents, air hockey is $1.00.</p>

<p>You can bring in a cake and your own soda, or whatever you want inside the party room.  We do not have a freezer, so we cannot store ice cream cakes.  We ask that you do not bring the party room refreshments outside of the party room.</p>

<p>You can <span class="bold">reserve this room</span> by calling Jim Fitzpatrick at 660-665-5684 (theater), or 660-342-1328 (cell).  We will need to know the date, showtime and movie you will attend, the amount of people attending, and whether you want the party before or after the movie.  We will put you on the calendar and have the room ready for your arrival.</p>

<p>Feel free to call me, at the numbers listed above, with pricing questions!</p>

<h1 id="viptickets" style='text-align: left;font-weight:400; font-size: 36px; line-height: 30px;'>VIP Tickets</h1>

<p>We sell <span class="bold">VIP tickets</span> in groups of 30 or more, at a $7.00 price for each.</p>

<p>They can be used for admission to any movie, any time.  They are a better value when used on the evening shows, saving $1.50 off the adult admission.</p>

<p>They can be used as employee incentives, gifts, or for your own movie going pleasure.  Either way, you can save money by buying in bulk amounts.</p>

<p>The passes are available from the manager on duty.  Inquire at the boxoffice, or call the business phone number at 660-665-5684 (theater), or 660-342-1328 (cell).  No showtime information is available at either number.  Movie information is available at the numbers posted at the top of the page.</p>
