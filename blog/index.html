	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>For the beverage label project I was missing the magazine ad, the 3 posters, the design of the 6 pack, and the 15 second commercial.  This is an anylization of why I missed the deadline.</p>

<p>The budget on the label was correct and I more or less met that I just spread that time out too much working on other school work. But when I came to the 6 pack carrier I ran into trouble.  The first speed bump was that the HP printer was out of order, and since the project was for 22x28 paper that&rsquo;s what I was planning on using.  I then had to redesign a new style of 6 pack for 17x22 paper so that I could get some physical mock ups and start testing the fit.  I have the fit basically down now and the design work on it is ready to begin.</p>

<p>My main problem would be because of my process.  For the branding and the commercial I needed to use the actual bottle, which meant I couldn&rsquo;t begin that until I had finished the label.  Once that is done I can photograph the bottles for my ads and use them in my commercial.  This process makes the budget for the rest of the project weigh on the first design, and the delays on that design compounded for every design after that.</p>

<p>For my time budgets that I spent on these projects I am proud to say that I don&rsquo;t t hink I really went over budget on any of them, at least not enough to notice.  I made sure to always be under budget by the due date so I&rsquo;d have some left over time to get some revisions done.  My thought process while working on these was to kind of &lsquo;rush&rsquo; it so that I&rsquo;d be able to get the initial progress down and then spend most of my time revising it.  I also spent a significant amount of time coming up with concepts and brainstorming, which I think helped my projects to reduce how many times I&rsquo;d need to start over.  If I wanted to improve my time management I think I just need to make sure my concepts are actually good before I do them, because for the Jazz Combo one it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

<p>As far as a general self-reflection, I&rsquo;d say I learned quite a few things of what I am good and what I am bad at.  I think I am good at getting the work done once I know what my idea is, meaning I am good at the computer design work.  I&rsquo;m also decent at coming up with ideas, but it kinda takes a lot of time so I&rsquo;m not that good.  I think I&rsquo;m also decent at taking pictures, but that might be because I know I am terrible at illustrating so I need to be good at it.  I&rsquo;m obviously bad at Illustration, and some times I just make some dumb mistakes layout wise and forget stuff like how the margin is supposed to be and it makes me have to totally start over.  I&rsquo;m also bad at keeping track of my time and printing things off on a regular basis.  Now that I know what this midterm portfolio is like, I&rsquo;m confident I can do a better job for the next one!</p>

		<p>For this assignment we were supposed to design a poster for the Herpatology Club open house event, which happened to be on Valentine&rsquo;s Day.  We were also required to take our own pics for it.  I had some bit of fun take pics of the reptiles in Magruder, but it was also pretty freaky.  I wasn&rsquo;t having fun being that close to those lizards.  Kept thinking they were gonna get out or something&hellip;  I originally made 3 different layouts because I really like the images I got and couldn&rsquo;t decide which was best.  Eventually I chose this one and the tag line fit really well.  It was weird to break some of the usual things we do and actually use a cheesy script font and a big goofy heart in the background.</p>

<p>This is the animated banner that we had to make.  Took forever to get it to look smooth.</p>

<p>This is the website design I made for the Herpatology club.  I made sure to type up some content because I wanted it to look more realistic than Lorem Ipsum text.<br/>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I spent a lot of time over the past week researching web design and working on our first real project in VisComm 3.  I choose to take a 960.gs approach because after doing some research it became apparent that it was previously a popular way to do web design prior to the responsive web design stuff.  It is a psd file that has columns set up already, you design the website in photoshop, and then use css to layout your site according to how you did it in photoshop.  I figured that since we are all about using grids for print design, it makes sense to use them for web layout as well.  I went with a 12 column grid.</p>

<p>The hardest trouble I had was with javascript.  I&rsquo;m not familiar with it.  I want to have some practical javascript not just some simple little button.  I went about trying to implement Fancybox into the website and spent many hours trying to get it to work.  Eventually I figured it out, the code I used had an extra javascript(); once I took that out it started working.  I went on to use Fancybox for the images and to open and iFrame to load a youtube video.</p>

<p>I really liked the approach of trying to design a website the way a real web designer would have, the tutorials I watched were incredibly valuable.  I had more fun watching the tutorials and learning the pracices than I did actually doing my own work.  For the next project I want to take the same approach, but learn responsive design.</p>

		<p>This assignment was to redo the Jazz Combo poster for OP.  We were only given 2 colors but a full bleed and had to do an illustration.  I struggled a lot with the illustrations, as is obviously by how bad it looks.  I&rsquo;m definitely better at photography than illustrating.<br/>
