<p>For my time budgets that I spent on these projects I am proud to say that I don&rsquo;t t hink I really went over budget on any of them, at least not enough to notice.  I made sure to always be under budget by the due date so I&rsquo;d have some left over time to get some revisions done.  My thought process while working on these was to kind of &lsquo;rush&rsquo; it so that I&rsquo;d be able to get the initial progress down and then spend most of my time revising it.  I also spent a significant amount of time coming up with concepts and brainstorming, which I think helped my projects to reduce how many times I&rsquo;d need to start over.  If I wanted to improve my time management I think I just need to make sure my concepts are actually good before I do them, because for the Jazz Combo one it didn&rsquo;t work out.</p>

<p>As far as a general self-reflection, I&rsquo;d say I learned quite a few things of what I am good and what I am bad at.  I think I am good at getting the work done once I know what my idea is, meaning I am good at the computer design work.  I&rsquo;m also decent at coming up with ideas, but it kinda takes a lot of time so I&rsquo;m not that good.  I think I&rsquo;m also decent at taking pictures, but that might be because I know I am terrible at illustrating so I need to be good at it.  I&rsquo;m obviously bad at Illustration, and some times I just make some dumb mistakes layout wise and forget stuff like how the margin is supposed to be and it makes me have to totally start over.  I&rsquo;m also bad at keeping track of my time and printing things off on a regular basis.  Now that I know what this midterm portfolio is like, I&rsquo;m confident I can do a better job for the next one!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For this assignment we were supposed to design a poster for the Herpatology Club open house event, which happened to be on Valentine&rsquo;s Day.  We were also required to take our own pics for it.  I had some bit of fun take pics of the reptiles in Magruder, but it was also pretty freaky.  I wasn&rsquo;t having fun being that close to those lizards.  Kept thinking they were gonna get out or something&hellip;  I originally made 3 different layouts because I really like the images I got and couldn&rsquo;t decide which was best.  Eventually I chose this one and the tag line fit really well.  It was weird to break some of the usual things we do and actually use a cheesy script font and a big goofy heart in the background.</p>

<p>This is the animated banner that we had to make.  Took forever to get it to look smooth.</p>

<p>This is the website design I made for the Herpatology club.  I made sure to type up some content because I wanted it to look more realistic than Lorem Ipsum text.<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This assignment was to redo the Jazz Combo poster for OP.  We were only given 2 colors but a full bleed and had to do an illustration.  I struggled a lot with the illustrations, as is obviously by how bad it looks.  I&rsquo;m definitely better at photography than illustrating.<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This assignment was to create a fake Type Foundry company and then create a brochure for it.  We also had to design a big poster advertising one of the fonts, and a website for the company.
